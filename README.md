# LogisticRegressionWithNeuralNetwork_Kitty

This project demonstrates how to use logistic regression with a neural network mindset to classify images of cats and non-cats. The primary goal is to understand the workflow of building a logistic regression classifier combined with neural network concepts. The project uses a dataset of cat and non-cat images and includes steps for loading, visualizing, processing, training the model, and making predictions. You can also upload your own images for prediction after training the model.
